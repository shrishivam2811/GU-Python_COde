Python practice questions

1. String Manipulation:
• Write a Python program to take a string input from the user and print its length.

2. List Operations:
• Write a Python program to create a list of numbers input by the user and then print the sum of all the numbers in the list.

3. Dictionary Operations:
• Write a Python program to create a dictionary where the keys are names of fruits and the values are their respective quantities. Ask the user to input the name of a fruit and then print its quantity from the dictionary.

4. Tuple Operations:
• Write a Python program to create a tuple containing the names of months. Print the 
length of the tuple and then print the months in reverse order.

5. Set Operations:
• Write a Python program to create two sets of numbers input by the user and then 
perform set operations like union, intersection, and difference between the two sets.

6. Arithmetic Operators:
• Write a Python program to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, division) on two numbers input by the user.

7. Comparison Operators:
• Write a Python program to compare two numbers input by the user and print whether 
the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.

8. Logical Operators:
• Write a Python program to check if a number input by the user is between 10 and 20 
(inclusive) using logical operators.

9. Assignment Operators:
• Write a Python program to demonstrate the usage of compound assignment operators 
by performing operations like +=, -=, *=, /= on a variable.

10. Bitwise Operators:
• Write a Python program to perform bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and complement 
operations on two integers input by the user.

11. Tuple Creation and Access:
• Write a Python program to create a tuple containing the following elements: 10, 20, 
30, 40, 50. Then, print the element at index 3.

12. Tuple Manipulation:
• Write a Python program to concatenate two tuples (1, 2, 3) and (4, 5, 6) into a single tuple.

13. Tuple Length:
• Write a Python program to find the number of elements in the tuple (10, 20, 30, 40, 
50).

14. Tuple Sorting:
• Write a Python program to sort the tuple (5, 3, 8, 2, 7) in ascending order and store the result in a new tuple.

15. List Creation and Access:
• Write a Python program to create a list containing the following elements: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. Then, print the element at index 2.

16. List Manipulation:
• Write a Python program to append the element 60 to the end of the list [10, 20, 30, 
40, 50].

17. Student Database:
• You are developing a student management system for a school. How would you use a 
dictionary to store student records, where each student's name is a key and their 
details (such as age, grade, and subjects) are stored as values? Write functions to add new students, update their information, and retrieve student details.

18. Employee Directory:
• You are developing an employee directory for a company. How would you use a 
dictionary to store employee information, where each employee's ID is a key and 
their details (such as name, department, and contact information) are stored as 
values? Write functions to add new employees, update their details, and search for 
employees by ID or name.

19. Inventory Management:
• You are building an inventory management system for a grocery store. How would 
you use a dictionary to represent the inventory, with each item as a key and its 
quantity as the corresponding value? Write a function to update the inventory when 
new items are purchased or sold.

20. Dictionary Creation and Access:
• Write a Python program to create a dictionary containing the following key-value 
pairs: 'apple': 3, 'banana': 5, 'orange': 2. Then, print the value associated with the key 'banana'.

21. Dictionary Iteration:
• Write a Python program to iterate over the following dictionary {'apple': 3, 'banana': 5, 'orange': 2} and print each key-value pair.

22. Dictionary Length:
• Write a Python program to find the number of key-value pairs in the dictionary 
{'apple': 3, 'banana': 5, 'orange': 2}.

23. Dictionary Update:
• Write a Python program to update the value of 'banana' to 7 in the dictionary {'apple': 3, 'banana': 5, 'orange': 2}.

24. Dictionary Deletion:
• Write a Python program to remove the key-value pair 'orange': 2 from the dictionary 
{'apple': 3, 'banana': 5, 'orange': 2}.

25. Dictionary Sorting:
• Write a Python program to sort the dictionary {'apple': 3, 'banana': 5, 'orange': 2} based on the values in ascending order.
